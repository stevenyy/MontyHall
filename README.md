Classic Monty Hall Problem with three monty version


The AlternativeMonty has the clear movement, and spin, but for some reason, it is not compatiable with Chrome, and in fixing so, some feature breaked. Currently, Mode2Move is not working as it can't get back to reshuffle after one round.

The MontyHall is the one that is compatible to largest number of platforms. However, the clear spin, and clear move feature is to incorporated.
